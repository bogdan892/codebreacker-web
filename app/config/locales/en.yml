  rules: "Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code created by a code-maker. The codemaker, which will be played by the application weâ€™re going to write, creates a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6.<br>
          The codebreaker gets some number of chances to break the code (depends on chosen difficulty). In each turn, the codebreaker makes a guess of 4 numbers. The codemaker then marks the guess with up to 4 signs - + or - or empty spaces.<br>
          A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code and in the same position. For example:<br>
          Secret number - 1234<br>
          Input number - 6264<br>
          Number of pluses - 2 (second and fourth position)<br>
          A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code but in a different position. For example:<br>
          Secret number - 1234<br>
          Input number - 6462<br>
          Number of minuses - 2 (second and fourth position)<br>"
